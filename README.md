Used to build a driver from source code for a 64 bit Windows OSVR distribution.

Tested on Windows 10 with HDK2 (MB 2.0 firmware) headset and it is working great (date: december/2021).

Copy and overwrite all bin .ddl files from this repository to your local HDK-Suite installation folder.

The default HDK-Software-Suite path is: C:\Program Files\HDK-Software-Suite\OSVR-SteamVR\osvr\bin\win64

I highly recommend to use old oculus build of SteamVR, unless you have improved your HDK tracking accuracy.

Enjoy :)
